A minimal, elastic [Reddit](http://reddit.com/) web app reader client, that lets you create "Channels" to group as many subreddits as you want into one stream.

* #### Minimalist
While aiming for simplicity, Reeddit cares to show you only the most important information from the posts and comments. No up-votes or points shown.

* #### Elastic
Reeddit has 3 different elastic layouts - you can use it on any window size. So it's comfortable to use on smartphones, tablets and desktops.

* #### Read-only
Reeddit can be used for browsing subreddits and viewing links/post and its comments, but not for voting or commenting... for now ;) -- The subreddits and channels you add are saved locally, however, so you don't lose your data.

* #### Channels
Channels let you group subreddits into one stream, so you can browse their links in a single view, instead of having to browse each one separately. This is specially nice when you add subject-related subreddits.

To build Reeddit, I used these awesome resources:

*	[pagedown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/) -- for Markdown parsing.
*	[Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) -- Lightweight client-side templating.
*	[reziseend.js](https://github.com/porada/resizeend) -- Better 'resize' handler.
