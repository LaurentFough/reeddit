# Reeddit

A minimalist, elastic and read-only [Reddit](http://reddit.com/) web app client, that lets you create "Channels", which groups as many subreddits as you want into one stream.

* #### Minimalist
While aiming for simplicity, Reeddit cares to show you only the most important information from the posts and comments. No upvotes or points.

* #### Elastic
Reeddit has 3 different elastic layouts - you can use it on any window size. So it's comfortable to use on a smartphone, tablet or desktop.

* #### Read-only
Being a personal side-project of mine, Reeddit can be used for browsing subreddits and viewing links/post and its comments, but not for voting or commenting... for now ;) -- However, the subreddits and channels you add are saved locally, so you don't lose any of that data.

* #### Channels
Channels let you group subreddits into one stream, so you can browse their links in a single view, instead of having to browse each one separately. This is specially useful when you add subject-related subreddits.

## Tools

To build Reeddit, I used these awesome resources:

*	[Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) -- basically, jQuery for modern browsers. Lighter, and with various useful tools for mobile sites and apps.
*	[Tappable](https://github.com/cheeaun/tappable) -- Great 'tap' events handler.
*	[pagedown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/) -- Client-side Markdown-to-HTML conversion.
*	[Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) -- Lightweigth client-side templating.
*	[reziseend.js](https://github.com/porada/resizeend) -- Better 'resize' handler.
* [Iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com/) -- Awesome icons.
